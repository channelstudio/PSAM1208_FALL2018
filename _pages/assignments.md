  * [learn.freecodecamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org) - complete the Basic CSS section under "Responsive Web Design Certification". Skip the last 7 sections on CSS variables and media queries. These are for your benefit so if you already feel comfortable with an exercise then you can skip.

  * If you haven't already, please email us the link to your GitHub Pages before class
  * We've updated "how to create new pages on GitHub" (found [here]( {{ 'guides/using_github_pages.html' | absolute_url }} )) to include an important final step
  * Rather than make a new repository for each project, feel free to make folders in your "[username].github.io" folder and publish that way, if that is easier

## Week 2 (due 9/12)
