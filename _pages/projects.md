## Project 1 - Hyperlink Text

Using [My Boyfriend Came Back From the War](http://www.teleportacia.org/war/) as inspiration, publish either your own or an existing poem, short story, or article on GitHub, line by line or paragraph by paragraph. Publish each line/section/stanza/paragraph as a separate html page. The text should be broken up into at least five pages. Link to the next page in the page before. Experiment with wrapping different elements in the \<a\> tag. What can you use as a “next” button? Try images, text, and other HTML elements. Creativity is encouraged with this assignment! A template can be found [here](https://github.com/wdbasics/assignment_1_template).
