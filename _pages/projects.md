## Project 3 - 15 Variations

### Week 1 

Find a piece of text that could easily fit on one printed page. This could be an excerpt from an essay, an interview, poem, etc. You will make 15 variations of this text. Each variation will be a separate webpage. For each variation, you will focus on changing the text's form through shifts in composition, typography, hierarchy, scale, and pacing. The text's content must remain intact throughout all 15 variations. Define 5 rules of changes for your text. For each of the rule come up with 3 variations each. For example, if the first rule is scale, then invent 3 significantly different ways of scaling the text. The purpose of the assignment is to push the boundaries and play with legibility, so no minor changes—shoot for making as broad a variation as possible. Do not use images. 

For inspiration take a look at Carl Dair’s [principles of typographic contrast](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qULLI4dcY1gE54EaLxhYmL_Bq7puo5qI) that we discussed in week 3


## Project 2 - Iterations on a poster 

### Week 1

Choose a real or fake event that you want to promote. Using flexbox, make five iterations of a promotional poster for the event using some sort of a system or grid. There should be a name for the event, date, place, description, and anything else you would like to include (graphics, contact etc). These should be quick iterations that we will refine in the next class and for the following week. Take a look at [vertical rhythm](http://verticalrhythm.org/) or some of the early Swiss posters by Josef Müller-Brockmann if you need inspiration.

### Week 2

Continue refining your posters. If you'd like to more closely follow the style of an existing poster using flexbox this is also acceptable.

## Project 1 - Hyperlink Text 

### Week 1

Using [My Boyfriend Came Back From the War](http://www.teleportacia.org/war/) as inspiration, publish either your own or an existing poem, short story, or article on GitHub, line by line or paragraph by paragraph. Publish each line/section/stanza/paragraph as a separate html page. The text should be broken up into at least five pages. Link to the next page in the page before. Experiment with wrapping different elements in the \<a\> tag. What can you use as a “next” button? Try images, text, and other HTML elements. Creativity is encouraged with this assignment! A template can be found [here](https://github.com/wdbasics/assignment_1_template).

### Week 2

Take the assignment you made for week 1 and use external CSS to style it. Experiment with using different selectors to target elements on your pages. Make sure to try using margin, padding, width, height, font, color, and background rules. Also be sure that you use only CSS for styling your page - no [inline styles](https://www.lifewire.com/avoid-inline-styles-for-css-3466846) in the HTML or use of the \<center\> [obsolete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/center) tag. Try to give each page its own unique style.
