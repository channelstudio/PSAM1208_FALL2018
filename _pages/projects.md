# Projects

## Project 1 - Hyperlink Text 

### Week 1

Using [My Boyfriend Came Back From the War](http://www.teleportacia.org/war/) as inspiration, publish either your own or an existing poem, short story, or article on GitHub, line by line or paragraph by paragraph. Publish each line/section/stanza/paragraph as a separate html page. The text should be broken up into at least five pages. Link to the next page in the page before. Experiment with wrapping different elements in the \<a\> tag. What can you use as a “next” button? Try images, text, and other HTML elements. Creativity is encouraged with this assignment! A template can be found [here](https://github.com/wdbasics/assignment_1_template).

### Week 2

Take the assignment you made for week 1 and use external CSS to style it. Experiment with using different selectors to target elements on your pages. Make sure to try using margin, padding, width, height, font, color, and background rules. Also be sure that you use only CSS for styling your page - no [inline styles](https://www.lifewire.com/avoid-inline-styles-for-css-3466846) in the HTML or use of the \<center\> [obsolete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/center) tag. Try to give each page its own unique style.
