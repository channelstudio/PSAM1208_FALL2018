# Introduction

Web Design Basics is designed to introduce students to programming as a creative medium—as a way of making and exploring. The coursework focuses on developing a vocabulary of interaction design principles which can then be applied across a range of platforms. Students are encouraged to experiment with various media, tools, and techniques, ultimately producing a portfolio of interactive and visual projects designed for the screen. An emphasis is placed on typography as it applies to a screen context, research-based problem solving and a “learning through making” approach to technical skill building. Historical and current interaction design precedents will be discussed.Open to: All university undergraduate degree students, except Communication Design and Design & Technology majors.
